Performance work is easiest when you start with measurable bottlenecks.

I begin by checking Core Web Vitals and identifying whether slowdowns come from JavaScript, images, or network waterfalls. Then I prioritize changes with the largest user impact.

In most projects, quick wins include optimized images, reduced third-party scripts, and smarter caching. I also lazy-load non-critical UI and trim heavy client-side logic where server rendering is enough.

Small improvements stack up. A faster page usually comes from many focused decisions rather than one dramatic rewrite.
